# devver

## Devver is designed to be a "one stop shop" for the budding web developer. It provides links to interview prep, algorithm practice, job boards, and finally web development news and forums.

## It's inspired by Americana in the 1950s. Haven't decided why yet, but I'm a fan of the style and thought it would be a good fit.

## It's built with React, which has been cool to work with.
